Back in October, I posted about my writing journey and [considered if there would be a second edition of _Modern CSS_](/blog/four-years-of-modern-css). Well, I'm happy to share that it's happening! I'm hard at work writing the second edition. I'm not sure yet when it will be published, but I hope to have the draft finished by the summer.

Some of the new topics being covered include:

-   The `:has:` and `:is` pseudo-classes
-   Nested CSS rules
-   Conic gradients
-   Animating to `height:auto` and more with `interpolate-size`
-   Subgrid
-   Container queries

I'll post more when I have something new to share. But I'm excited to dive back into CSS again. As with the first edition, I'm sure I'll learn a lot along the way as well.

For now, you can find details on the first edition [here](/books/modern-css).
